<h1>The Gertrude Steinifier</h1>
<p id="about">Gertrude Stein was a modern poet known for <a href="Gertrude_Stein.pdf" class="gert">her calculated experimentation</a> with grammar, syntax, and parts of speech. A fixture of the avant garde scene of Paris in the 1920's, her legacy has been highly influential in the development of many mid-to-late century schools of poetics. One area where Stein's poetics have been most influential is in <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/brief-guide-language-poetry" class="gert">language poetry</a>, where writers believe that language dictates meaning, and readers play an active role in ascribing a meaning to a text. 
<br><br>
Inspired by Stein's legacy and influence in contemporary poetry movements, The Gertrude Steinifier is a language poetry generator that uses <a href="https://rednoise.org/rita/" class="gert">the RiTa.js library</a> to modify sentences based on sound. The "rhyme" function returns random rhyming words, while the "reason" function returns random woulds with general alliterative similarities.
